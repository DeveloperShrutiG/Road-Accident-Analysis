# Road-Accident-Analysis (Using Excel)

ðŸš—ðŸ“Š I'm excited to share my latest project: **An Excel Dashboard analyzing UK road accident data!** ðŸ“ˆ

In this project, I've delved deep into the numbers to uncover insights about accident trends, locations, and contributing factors. This analysis aims to provide a clearer understanding of road safety issues and help in formulating strategies to mitigate accidents.

 #### Requirement: Client wants to create a Road Accident Dashboard for year 2021 & 2022 so that they can have insights on the given requirement

* Primary KPI's:
  - Total casualities taken place after the accident
  - Total casualities & Percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualities by type of vehicle 

* Secondary KPI's:
  -Total casualities with respect to vehicle type
  - Monthly trend showing comparison of casuality for current year and previous year
  - Maximum casuality by road type
  -  Distribution of total casualities by road surface
  -  Relation between  Casualities by Area/location & by day/night.

* Stakeholders Involved:
  - Ministry Of Transport
  - Road Transport Department
  - Police Force
  - Emergency Service Department
  - Road Safety Corps
  - Transport Operators
  - Traffic Management Agencies
  - Public
  - Media
    
    
### Tool Used:
- **Microsoft Excel**

### Process Followed:

1. **Reading Data:**
   - Acquired and familiarized myself with the UK road accident dataset.
   - Ensured a thorough understanding of the variables and their significance.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed any inconsistencies and errors in the dataset.
   - Addressed missing values and standardized data formats to ensure accuracy.

3. **Processing Data:**
   - Created additional columns such as month and year for time-based analysis.
   - Added calculated fields to support deeper analysis and insights.

4. **Data Analysis:**
   - Used Pivot Tables to summarize and explore data trends.
   - Identified key patterns and correlations between different variables.

### Key Learnings:

- **Creating Multiple Pivot Tables:**
  - Developed several Pivot Tables to analyze different aspects of the data.
  - Enabled comprehensive examination of accident trends by various dimensions like location, time, and severity.

- **Utilization of Formulas:**
  - Applied advanced Excel formulas to make the dashboard dynamic and interactive.
  - Enhanced data insights through calculated metrics and conditional formatting.

- **Using Hyperlinks:**
  - Incorporated hyperlinks for easy navigation within the dashboard.
  - Provided quick access to relevant sections and integrated email links for direct communication.

- **Grouping Categorical Data:**
  - Grouped similar categories to simplify data presentation.
  - Improved clarity and usability of the dashboard for better decision-making outcomes.

### Conclusion:

This project not only improved my skills in data cleaning, processing, and analysis using Excel but also provided valuable insights into road safety trends. I am eager to apply these learnings to future projects and continue exploring data-driven solutions.

Feel free to explore the project and provide any feedback. Let's connect and discuss how we can leverage data to enhance road safety further!
